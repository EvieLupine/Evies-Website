    <h1>My Amazing Cat Charlie</h1>
    <h2>Charlie is a sixteen year old Tonkinese cat and he is currently doing well but experiencing the effects of aging</h2> </h2>
<h3> He is a cat of character and he is a very proud cat. Everywhere we have moved we've taken him with us from England to Singapore or to Hong Kong to New Zealand, Charlie is a very experienced traveler. Originally Charlie was born in 2007 September 14th in Singapore along with me also being born there. My cat enjoys hot weather and chicken but because of how old he is becoming we can only allow food that is for old cats like him, he is still a ferocious spirit and enjoys running around, playing and he's always up for a cuddle.</h3>
</h3>
    <p>My family and me all really love Charlie because he is a cat you can talk to whatever about and he will reply with a Thesuraus of meows. Since he is half Siamese he is very shouty and will demand whatever he wishes, as he has gotten older the worse it has become but we tolerate it because we honestly think of it as less annoying than the dog. Any new people who enter the house will be greeted with a nip on the ankle by Charlie since he likes to determine wether you are worthy of entering his home. You should know that it is his house not ours, he runs it. Even at night you are not safe, he will demand that all doors are to be kept open so he may enter and annoy you in the night.</p>

    <p>Charlie is no regular cat he is the regal icon of my house and there is no comming close to his level, he sits with his head up high and a squinting face that judges your everymove. He will subtlely reposition himself every few minutes by keeping his paws close to his feet, he also keeps himself looking tidy and formal at all times just to remind you of how much power he holds. Charlie is obviously better than the dog at most things like making sure I don't sleep at night because I'm training to place my arm so he may sleep in the most awkward position imaginable. To add, his postition of power is so mopdest that he only drinks from a glass on the kitchen island.</p>
